      <motion.p variants={item}>My interest in coding is rooted in my fascination with human languages, which are also a complex form of code, and a passion for learning and cultivating skills from various domains. Over the years, this love of knowledge has enriched me culturally, transformed my worldview and led me to acquire a host of skills that have benefited me throughout life, the latest such skill being programming. I've been studying web development for over two years, during which time I've familiarized myself with a range of languages, frameworks and libraries and built several projects, some of which can be found on this website.</motion.p>
